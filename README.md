# The VisEnsemble

Welcome to The VisEnsemble Choir website! This is a mock-up website for a real choir for visually impaired people in Dublin called 'The Visionaries Choir'.  This website hopes to help people become more aware of what the choir is about and who are its members, motivate other visually impaired people to become members and to increase opportunities for public performances.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to demonstrate skills in HTML and CSS.  Some JavaScript is used for interactivity and to make the website better accessible with screen-readers.

It is a mobile-first built and is responsive on tablet, desktop and screens up to 2000px wide. It is also compatible with all popular browsers. 

The website is intended to target the visually impaired community including friends, families and organisations for the blind/visually impaired/disabled as well as event organisers, State bodies, art Councils and the general public. 

They will be able to see the schedule of events, rehearsal times and locations as well as a way to learn about and contact the choir in order to join, seek further information or book them for an event. 

## Features

This section aims to describe the value of the different parts of the project for the user.

### Existing Features

* A Skip Navigation Link
  
  Featured on all four pages, the skip navigation link comes into view when it gets keyboard focus.  This allows the returning user to skip the logo and navigation links and go straight to the main content of the page.

* The Header / Navigation Bar

  Featured on all four pages, the fully responsive header includes:

1. A link to the Logo which brings the user to the home page.
2. A hamburger button on mobile which opens up a navigation list with links to the Home, About, Events and Contact pages. This helps reduce the clutter on the header by keeping the page links neatly stowed away until the user navigates to the hamburger button. The links have a hover and focus effect to help the user identify them as links. 
3. Links to the Home, About, Events and Contact pages on tablet and desktop which help the user to easily navigate from page to page without having to revert back to the previous page via the back button. The link to the current page is also underlined to help the user identify the page they are on.

* The Landing Page / Home Page Hero

  Includes a photograph of the choir with a text overlay which captures the essence of the choir.  This section introduces the sighted user to the choir with an eye catching image to grab their attention, the text gives the non-sighted user a very brief introduction to the choir.
