# The VisEnsemble

Welcome to The VisEnsemble Choir website! This is a mock-up website for a real choir for visually impaired people in Dublin called 'The Visionaries Choir'.  This website hopes to help people become more aware of what the choir is about and who are its members, motivate other visually impaired people to become members and to increase opportunities for public performances.
