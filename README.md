# The VisEnsemble

Welcome to The VisEnsemble Choir website! This is a mock-up website for a real choir for visually impaired people in Dublin called 'The Visionaries Choir'.  This website hopes to help people become more aware of what the choir is about and who are its members, motivate other visually impaired people to become members and to increase opportunities for public performances.

## Overview

The aim of this project is to demonstrate skills in HTML and CSS.  Some JavaScript is used for interactivity and to make the website better accessible with screen-readers.

It is a mobile-first built and is responsive on tablet, desktop and screens up to 2000px wide. It is also compatible with all popular browsers. 

The website is intended to target the visually impaired community including friends, families and organisations for the blind/visually impaired/disabled as well as event organisers, State bodies, art Councils and the general public. 

They will be able to see the schedule of events, rehearsal times and locations as well as a way to learn about and contact the choir in order to join, seek further information or book them for an event. 

## Features

This section aims to describe the value of the different parts of the project for the user.

### Existing Features

* A Skip Navigation Link
  
  Featured on all four pages, the skip navigation link comes into view when it gets keyboard focus.  This allows the returning user to skip the logo and navigation links and go straight to the main content of the page.

  ![Skip Navigation Button in Focus](assets/documentation/tabdesk-skipnav.png)

* The Header / Navigation Bar

  Featured on all four pages, the fully responsive header includes:

1. A link to the Logo which brings the user to the home page.
2. A hamburger button on mobile which opens up a navigation list with links to the Home, About, Events and Contact pages. This helps reduce the clutter on the header by keeping the page links neatly stowed away until the user navigates to the hamburger button. The links have a hover and focus effect to help the user identify them as links. 
3. Links to the Home, About, Events and Contact pages on tablet and desktop which help the user to easily navigate from page to page without having to revert back to the previous page via the back button. The link to the current page is also underlined to help the user identify the page they are on.

* The Landing Page / Home Page Hero

  Includes a photograph of the choir with a text overlay which captures the essence of the choir.  This section introduces the sighted user to the choir with an eye catching image to grab their attention, the text gives the non-sighted user a very brief introduction to the choir.

* Home Page Main Content

  The Home Page Main Content features:
1. An inspiring quote by Helen Keller which introduces the ethos of the choir presented in a blockquote format with a picture of Helen Keller on the left. This is meant to motivate the user to read on about the vision of the choir.
2. The Vision Section allows the user to see the benefits of joining the choir, as well as the benefits of singing overall. It is presented with icons which help the sighted user to distinguish between the different statements presented.  Screen readers will ignore these icons completely and move on to the text instead. This should encourage the user to consider joining the choir to help improve their quality of life. 
3. The Call to Action (CTA) card includes a background image with a thick orange border to draw the eye. The text overlay expresses the call for new members and directs the eye to the bright orange button at the bottom which links to the contact page. The button has a hover and focus effect to make the user aware that it will lead to somewhere. This is meant to give the user a quick and easy way to get to the sign up page at the end.  It is placed on the Home page to encourage more users to get in touch.

* A Back to Top Link
  
  Featured on all four pages, the back to top button is placed right before the footer for easy navigation. It is linked with the skip navigation link to bring the sighted user to the top of the page and gives the keyboard navigation user the option to either skip to main content or go through the navigation list in the header.  It also has a hover and focus effect to help the user identify it as an interactive asset.  

![Back to Top Button and footer](assets/documentation/mob-backtotop-footer.png)

* A Footer

  Featured on all four pages, includes icons which when clicked or focussed on will bring up a phone number and email address for easy contact with the choir master.  Screen readers are able to read out the phone numbers and the email address as well.  The social icons are labelled links which will open in a new tab to allow for easy navigation for the user.  The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to get in touch via phone or email if they prefer that method of contact and it also allows the user to keep connected via social media. (Refer to image above)

* The About Page

1. The About page opens with an about us section which is overlayed on a background image.  It displays a paragraph on the history of the choir and a read more button which when clicked brings up the rest of the choir history. The read more button was added to reduce the amount of text visible on the page, it is up to the user if they want to find out more about the history of the choir or move on to the next section. The feature has a read less button as well which will hide the second chunck of text once read. 
2. The flip card with a snippet of the Conductor's Biography is an eye catching feature which displays a photo of the conductor with a background of piano keys and information about his qualifications and conducting experience.  This is helpful for the user as it gives more information about the Conductor as well as links to his social media for more information or to connect. 
3. The Rehearsal card is a useful feature on which the rehearsal day and time, location and cost are displayed.  The icons are accessible by screen readers and have a little tooltip explaining what they are.  It also has a link to google maps to aid with finding the location of the rehearsal venue as well as a link to the contact page to encourage the user to sign up.

* The About Page Continued

4. The Audio Section provides the user with supporting evidence showing what the choir's repertoire of songs sounds like.  Although these are temporary arrangments of the songs the choir uses, in the future they will be actual recordings to showcase the choir's talent.  This is valuable to both visually impaired and sighted users and event organisers can have a better idea of what type of events will suit the choir.
5. The Testimonials Section provides feedback from some of the choir members.  This is very useful to the user as it gives them an overview of how the choir works and the benefits people living with sightloss experience when joining the choir.

### Future Features

## User Experience (UX) / User Interface (UI)

### Strategy/Site Goals
The main goal of the website is to make the public aware of The VisEnsemble Choir.  It hopes to motivate more visually impaired people to join as members and to increase the number of supporters and followers of The VisEnsemble Choir.  The overall objective of this website is to aid in creating a well-established and well-rounded choir and as a result to increase the number of ticket sales and performances per year.  

### Scope/User Stories

### Structure/Design Choices
  A four page website which offers simplicity and consistency within its structure.  The Navigation menu displays the choir’s logo and links to the different pages on the website, for easy navigation.  This is repeated across all pages.  The Footer displays social media links which open in a separate tab for ease of use.  The footer is also repeated across all pages to keep the design uniform and for ease of access. 

### Skeleton/Wireframes
Wireframes were firstly sketched with pen and paper.  This method helped me with brainstorming, deciding the most essential parts for the website and getting a feel for the website as a whole.

Right click to view Mobile Wireframes [Here](assets/documentation/TVE%20Mobile.pdf)

Right click to view Desktop Wireframes [Here](assets/documentation/TVE%20Desktop.pdf)

Note: Through the design phase some elements were changed to allow for a better user experience.

### Surface
This section defines the visual language of the website.

* Colour Scheme

  The colour orange was chosen as the primary colour for the website as it represents friendliness, enthusiasm and creativity. It was used for the logo and header text as well as important text and buttons to draw the eye. 

  [ColorMind](http://colormind.io/) was used to generate the following colour palette. 

![Colour Palette Used](assets/documentation/colourmind-palette.png)

  The colour Outer Space was used as the dark shade for the header and footer background as well as the website's main typeface.

  The colour Green White was used as a light shade for the background on some cards and text color on the contact page.

  The colour Edward was used as a light accent with increased or decreased brightness and/or opacity for certain features.

  The colour Limed Oak was used with opacity for the body background and the contact page text inputs. 


* Typography

Google fonts Roboto and Nunito were chosen for the website.  They are both sans-serif fonts which have a higher readability than serif fonts.
